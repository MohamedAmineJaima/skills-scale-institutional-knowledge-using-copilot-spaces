# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management documentation hub! This collection of guides and processes is designed to help you understand how we plan, execute, and deliver projects at OctoAcme. Whether you're a new team member getting oriented, a developer looking for process guidance, or a project manager seeking best practices, you'll find the resources you need here.

## About OctoAcme's Approach

OctoAcme follows a **structured yet iterative approach** to project management, anchored in customer-first principles and data-informed decision-making. We believe that successful projects start with a clear understanding of customer needs and are driven by measurable outcomes. Every project decision—from feature prioritization to technical trade-offs—is grounded in evidence and aligned with delivering maximum customer value.

Our **project lifecycle** provides clear structure while maintaining flexibility: we begin with **initiation** to validate the business need and align stakeholders, move through **planning** to define scope and resources, execute with **day-to-day rhythm** of standups and reviews, proceed to **release** with careful deployment practices, and close with **retrospectives** to capture learnings. This lifecycle isn't rigid—it's a framework that teams adapt based on project complexity and context.

**Day-to-day execution** is powered by a predictable cadence: daily standups keep the team synchronized on progress and blockers, weekly delivery syncs provide visibility into milestones, and sprint demos showcase incremental value. Quality is built into every step through comprehensive testing strategies (unit, integration, end-to-end), continuous integration pipelines that catch issues early, and code review practices that encourage knowledge sharing. This rhythm creates a sustainable pace while maintaining high standards.

**Collaboration** at OctoAcme is driven by eight core personas working together:
- **Developers** build and test features
- **Product Managers** define outcomes and prioritize
- **Project Managers** coordinate delivery and manage risks
- **QA Lead** ensures quality standards and testing rigor
- **Business Analyst** gathers and validates requirements
- **Scrum Master** facilitates agile ceremonies and removes impediments
- **UX Designer** advocates for user experience and accessibility
- **Data Analyst** provides insights and measures success

These roles work together through intentional and regular communication, using structured templates for project charters, risk registers, and release notes. Our standardized release processes include pre-flight checks, rollback plans, and post-deployment verification to minimize risk. After each sprint, release, or incident, we conduct retrospectives to identify improvements and share learnings, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and psychological safety.

## Core Principles

OctoAcme's project management approach is built on five foundational principles:

- **Customer-First**: We prioritize customer value and usability in every decision. Features are validated through user research and measured by their impact on customer satisfaction and success.

- **Iterative Delivery**: We deliver small, testable increments rather than big-bang releases. This enables faster feedback, reduces risk, and allows us to course-correct based on real-world data.

- **Clear Ownership**: Every project has a named Project Manager and Product Lead. Roles and responsibilities are well-defined, ensuring accountability and efficient decision-making.

- **Data-Informed Decisions**: We measure impact and iterate based on evidence. Success metrics are defined upfront, and we track them throughout the project lifecycle to guide our choices.

- **Psychological Safety**: We encourage feedback, learning, and experimentation. Team members feel safe raising concerns, sharing ideas, and acknowledging mistakes as opportunities for growth.

## Documentation Guide

This documentation is organized to mirror our project lifecycle. Each guide provides practical templates, checklists, and best practices for that phase of work.

### Process Documentation

The following seven guides walk through OctoAcme's project lifecycle from initiation to retrospective:

1. **[Project Management Overview](octoacme-project-management-overview.md)**  
   Start here for a concise introduction to OctoAcme's project management approach, including our principles, core roles, key artifacts, and communication cadence. This overview provides the foundation for understanding how all the pieces fit together.

2. **[Project Initiation](octoacme-project-initiation.md)**  
   Learn how to validate and authorize new work. This guide walks you through creating a project one-pager, identifying stakeholders, defining success metrics, and making go/no-go decisions. Use this when a new project idea is ready to be explored.

3. **[Project Planning](octoacme-project-planning.md)**  
   Detailed guidance for breaking down scope, estimating effort, identifying dependencies, and creating a release plan. This is your resource for sprint planning, resource allocation, and setting up project boards and tracking systems.

4. **[Execution & Tracking](octoacme-execution-and-tracking.md)**  
   Day-to-day execution guidance covering team rhythm (standups, weekly syncs, demos), pull request workflows, quality and testing standards, and reporting metrics. This guide helps teams maintain momentum while ensuring quality.

5. **[Risks & Communication](octoacme-risks-and-communication.md)**  
   Best practices for identifying and managing risks, escalation procedures, stakeholder communication templates, and status reporting. Use this to navigate blockers, dependencies, and keep everyone informed.

6. **[Release & Deployment](octoacme-release-and-deployment.md)**  
   Standardized release processes covering pre-release requirements, deployment checklists, smoke testing, rollback procedures, and incident response. This guide reduces deployment risk and ensures smooth releases.

7. **[Retrospective & Continuous Improvement](octoacme-retrospective-and-continuous-improvement.md)**  
   Learn how to run effective retrospectives after sprints, releases, and incidents. Includes facilitation tips, common formats, and techniques for capturing learnings and turning them into action items.
