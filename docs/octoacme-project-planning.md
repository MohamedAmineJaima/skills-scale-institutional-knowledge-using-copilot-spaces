# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria (Business Analyst supports)
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD)
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
6. Create release plan and milestone map
7. Define UX research and design approach (UX Designer)
8. Establish test strategy and QA approach (QA Lead)
9. Set up instrumentation and analytics tracking (Data Analyst)

## Backlog Item Template

## Sprint / Iteration Planning
- Timebox planning to agreed sprint length (Scrum Master facilitates)
- Pull items that meet DoD and have clear acceptance criteria
- Ensure team capacity is respected
- Include time for UX design reviews and usability testing
- Account for QA testing time in sprint capacity

## Risk & Dependency Management
- Capture in Risk Register:
  - ID, Description, Impact, Probability, Owner, Mitigation
- Mark cross-team dependencies in the project board and escalate during weekly syncs
- QA Lead flags quality and testing risks
- UX Designer identifies design or usability risks
- Data Analyst highlights measurement or instrumentation risks

## Role Involvement in Planning

- **Product Manager**: Prioritizes backlog, defines acceptance criteria, aligns on release plan
- **Project Manager**: Creates project plan, manages dependencies, coordinates across teams
- **Business Analyst**: Translates requirements into user stories, clarifies acceptance criteria
- **Scrum Master**: Facilitates sprint planning and backlog refinement, manages team capacity
- **Developers**: Estimate work, identify technical dependencies, review designs for feasibility
- **QA Lead**: Creates test strategy, estimates testing effort, reviews stories for testability
- **UX Designer**: Creates design plan, schedules user research and design reviews
- **Data Analyst**: Plans instrumentation, defines tracking specifications, sets up dashboards

## UX Designer: Design Planning Checklist

The **UX Designer** defines the design approach and creates artifacts to guide development.

### UX Research Planning
- [ ] Identify user research needs (interviews, surveys, usability studies)
- [ ] Define target user personas if not already established
- [ ] Review existing user feedback and analytics
- [ ] Plan usability testing sessions for key features
- [ ] Identify accessibility requirements and compliance needs

### Design Deliverables Planning
- [ ] Define design deliverables (wireframes, prototypes, high-fidelity mockups)
- [ ] Establish design review cadence with Product Manager and stakeholders
- [ ] Create design timeline aligned with development sprints
- [ ] Identify design system components needed or to be created
- [ ] Plan for responsive and multi-platform considerations

### Collaboration and Validation
- [ ] Schedule design reviews with stakeholders and developers
- [ ] Plan design handoff sessions with developers
- [ ] Define acceptance criteria for UI/UX features
- [ ] Establish feedback loops for iterative design improvements
- [ ] Coordinate with QA Lead on usability testing approach

## Data Analyst: Analytics Planning Checklist

The **Data Analyst** ensures success metrics can be tracked and measured throughout the project.

### Metrics Definition
- [ ] Review success metrics from project one-pager
- [ ] Define specific KPIs and measurement approach
- [ ] Identify baseline metrics where applicable
- [ ] Plan A/B testing or experimentation if needed
- [ ] Define data retention and privacy requirements

### Instrumentation Planning
- [ ] Identify events and user actions to track
- [ ] Work with developers on instrumentation requirements
- [ ] Define data schema and tracking specifications
- [ ] Plan for data validation and quality checks
- [ ] Coordinate with engineering on analytics tooling setup

### Reporting and Dashboards
- [ ] Design dashboards for real-time monitoring
- [ ] Define reporting cadence (daily, weekly, monthly)
- [ ] Identify stakeholders who need access to metrics
- [ ] Plan for anomaly detection and alerting
- [ ] Create data dictionary for common metrics and dimensions
