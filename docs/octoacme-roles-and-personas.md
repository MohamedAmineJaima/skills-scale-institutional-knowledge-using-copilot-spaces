### Improved Team Dynamics and Delivery
- **Scrum Master** maximizes team productivity by removing impediments, facilitating effective ceremonies, and protecting focus time
- Clear process ownership reduces confusion about who drives specific activities (e.g., retrospectives, backlog refinement)

### User-Centered Design and Validation
- **UX Designer** ensures solutions are intuitive and accessible, increasing user adoption and satisfaction
- Early design validation through prototypes reduces costly UI rework during development

### Evidence-Based Decision Making
- **Data Analyst** provides objective metrics to validate assumptions, measure impact, and prioritize work
- Teams can course-correct quickly based on real user behavior rather than opinions

### Clearer Accountability and Communication
- Each role has explicit ownership of key deliverables (test plans, requirements, designs, metrics)
- Cross-functional collaboration is more intentional with defined touchpoints between roles
- Less duplication of effort as responsibilities are clearly delineated

### Comprehensive Project Coverage
Together, these roles ensure that **all critical dimensions** of successful delivery are actively managed:
- **Quality** (QA Lead)
